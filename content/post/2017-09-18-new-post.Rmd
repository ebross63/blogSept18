This is a blog about data science.

I will use R to show examples

R Studio is easy to use, here are the packages you will need:

1. dplyr
2. Lahman

> The dplyr package is a grammar of data manipulation. Lahman provides stats from the history of professional baseball.

## Examples

First we must load packages:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)

```

Then we can explore the data:
```{r message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
Batting%>%
  filter(HR>50)%>%
  select(playerID,HR)
```
